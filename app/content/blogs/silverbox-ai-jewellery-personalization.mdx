# Building Silverbox.ai, Ending ShelfWear with Style and Science

Some products start with an idea. Silverbox.ai started with a lifetime of experience and a founder who deeply understood the problem.

---

## The Founder and The Problem

When Mariappan Muthiah came to us, he was not experimenting. He was solving something he had lived with for over 20 years in the jewellery industry.

He had seen it across major brands. He had seen it in showrooms. He had seen it in customers' homes.

**Women own jewellery, but don't wear it often.**

He called it ShelfWear. Jewellery that looks great in the store. But feels wrong in front of the mirror later.

---

## Why We Said Yes

At our product studio, we have a simple belief: We trust founders, not ideas.

Ideas change. Strong founders adapt.

Mariappan had clarity, conviction, and domain depth that cannot be faked. On top of that, Silverbox was supported by Suresh Sambandham through MudhalVC.

That made it a no brainer for us to work together. This was not just another D2C brand. This was a thoughtful attempt to redesign how women experience jewellery.

## The Real Issue

The issue was never lack of jewellery. The issue was mismatch:

- Mismatch between the woman and the jewellery
- Mismatch between the outfit and the piece
- Mismatch between the occasion and the design

Jewellery is still sold as isolated products. But women live in contexts.

Retail stores focus on selling. Not styling. And that gap creates buyer's remorse.

**Close to 30 percent of jewellery purchases come back for exchange.**

That is stressful for the customer. And inefficient for the brand.

---

## The Silverbox Solution

Silverbox.ai flips the model. We do not start with products. We start with the woman.

Together with the Silverbox team, we helped design and enhance the core experience around **Style DNA**:

- An experience that understands a woman's aesthetics and preferences
- An experience that removes guesswork
- An experience that shows how jewellery will actually look before buying

This is where human styling expertise meets AI. Not AI replacing taste. AI supporting better decisions.

---

## What We Built

As a product studio, we led key parts of the platform:

- User experience design that feels calm, premium, and confident
- AI personalisation logic that powers recommendations
- Website enhancements that bring Style DNA to life
- AI generated visual previews that help users imagine themselves, not a model

The goal was simple: Reduce uncertainty. Increase confidence. Make jewellery wearable, not just ownable.

---

## The Results

Silverbox.ai is now live and revenue generating. It already serves over 1,000 customers.

That matters. Because it proves something important: When you deeply understand a problem and build with intention, people respond.

This is not about bestsellers. It is about the best pieces for the individual.

## Final Thoughts

Silverbox.ai represents the kind of work we want to do more of:

- Founder led
- Problem first
- Design driven
- Technology as an enabler, not a gimmick

Mariappan poured his heart, soul, and two decades of experience into this brand. We were proud to help translate that into a product that works in the real world.

**This is how ShelfWear ends. With style. With science. And with founders who truly care.**

We believe in founders. If you are a founder with an idea and want to move from idea to product in 4 weeks, let's talk.
