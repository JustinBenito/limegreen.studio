# How We Built Our Landing Page

Building a landing page that feels simple, fast, and trustworthy is harder than it looks.  
In this post, we’ll walk through how we approached the redesign, the decisions we made, and what we learned along the way.

---

## Why We Redesigned

Our old landing page had grown organically over time. While it worked, it no longer reflected the quality of work we were delivering to clients.

Some of the problems we noticed:

- Too much visual noise
- Unclear messaging above the fold
- Poor performance on mobile
- No clear content hierarchy

We decided it was time to step back and rebuild with intent.

---

## Defining the Goals

Before touching any design tools or writing code, we defined a few clear goals:

- Communicate what we do within 5 seconds
- Keep the layout minimal and content-focused
- Optimize for readability and performance
- Make future updates easy

Having these constraints early helped us avoid over-designing.

---

## Our Tech Stack

We kept the stack intentionally small and boring:

- **Next.js (App Router)** for routing and performance
- **Tailwind CSS** for fast iteration and consistency
- **MDX** for content-driven sections like blogs
- **Vercel** for deployment

The goal was not to chase trends, but to choose tools that wouldn’t slow us down.

---

## Design Decisions That Mattered

A few small decisions had a surprisingly large impact:

- Using fewer font sizes
- Increasing line-height for long-form text
- Removing unnecessary borders and shadows
- Letting whitespace do more of the work

We focused more on spacing and hierarchy than visual effects.

---

## Challenges We Faced

Not everything went smoothly.

Some challenges included:

- Balancing brand personality with simplicity
- Making the layout work equally well on large and small screens
- Avoiding premature animations
- Resisting the urge to “add one more section”

In many cases, removing things led to better results than adding new ones.

---

## Performance Considerations

Performance was a non-negotiable requirement.

We:

- Avoided large client-side JavaScript
- Used static rendering wherever possible
- Optimized images and fonts
- Tested aggressively on slower devices

The end result was a noticeably faster site.

---

## What We’d Do Differently

If we were to do this again, we would:

- Involve content writing earlier
- Test copy variations sooner
- Lock spacing rules before polishing visuals

These lessons will guide future updates.

## Final Thoughts

A good landing page isn’t about flashy animations or complex interactions.  
It’s about clarity, trust, and focus.

By keeping things simple and intentional, we ended up with a site that feels more aligned with who we are and how we work.

If you’re planning a redesign, our biggest advice is this: **start with constraints, not inspiration.**
