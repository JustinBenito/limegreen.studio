# How we built a GenZ App

ComeAlign did not start as a random product idea.

It started with a founder who believed deeply in what he wanted to build.

## The Founder

Hakeem Awbrey had this idea for a long time. A dating app that moves away from blind swipes and surface level judgments. Something that actually means something to the people using it.

When Hakeem came to us, what stood out was not just the idea. It was his motivation. His clarity. His belief in the problem.

At our product studio, we trust founders, not ideas. Ideas evolve. Founders don't quit. That belief is what made us say yes.

## Retiring the blind swipe culture

Most dating apps today feel the same. Swipe left. Swipe right. Judge a person in 2 seconds.

Align wanted to do the opposite.

The core idea was simple: Match people based on zodiac compatibility rooted in over 10,000 years of astrological research.

Not looks first. Not bios first. But alignment first.

This was built for Gen Z and astrology believers. People who actually care about vibes, energy, and compatibility.

## The Design Challenge

Most zodiac based apps look dull. Muted colors. Generic icons. Feels like reading a horoscope newspaper column.

We did not want that.

From day one, we decided that ComeAlign had to feel alive. Colorful. Playful. Confident.

We custom designed everything from scratch. No templates. No shortcuts.

Every screen went through constant iteration with Hakeem. Design reviews. Feedback loops. Small tweaks that made a big difference.

Once we reached a design that Hakeem fully believed in, we moved to development.

## The Tech Stack

We chose Flutter to build the entire mobile application. Fast development. Smooth animations. One codebase for both Android and iOS.

From onboarding to matching screens, everything was carefully crafted:

- Animations were not an afterthought
- Micro interactions were intentional
- Buttons respond
- Transitions feel smooth
- The app feels fun to use

Honestly, this is one of the most colorful and visually pleasing apps we have built so far.

Behind the scenes, we also built a Node.js backend and AI powered matching logic that handles zodiac compatibility and user alignment.

## What We Delivered

As a product studio, we delivered ComeAlign end to end:

- Branding
- UI and UX
- Flutter based mobile app
- Backend systems
- AI powered matching logic

The product is currently in testing and entering the launch phase. ComeAlign is set to go live on the Play Store and App Store soon.

## Final Thoughts

If you are a founder with a strong belief and long term vision, we are always down to build with you.

**The Stars will get aligned.**
